# my-first-repo

This is a simple repository to help you learn the basics of git and GitHub. A few suggestions to get started:

1. You can open this repository using GitHub Codespaces (a web-based development environment) or you can clone it to your local computer and work on it there.
2. Whichever you choose, get some practice with the following actions:
     - Basic file management: Creating, editing, or deleting new and existing files
     - Adding files to your git repository
     - Committing files to your git repository with a meaningful commit message
     - Pushing your changes back to GitHub
4. You can perform these steps repeatedly, treating this repository as if it were a longer-running project.
